# Sassy Math

Sassy Math is a tool designed to expand upon Sass and Compass's built in mathematic operations to include more advanced functions needed for complex calculations. These calculations may include mathematics based grid layouts, complex background images, advanced CSS animations, and anything else you can imagine.

## Requirements

Sassy Math is a Compass extension, so make sure you have [Sass and Compass Installed](http://compass-style.org/install/) in order to use its awesomeness!

## Install

`sudo gem install sassy-math`

#### If creating a new project
`compass create <my_project> -r sassy-math`

#### If adding to existing project, in config.rb
`require 'sassy-math'`

*There are no partials to import! As long as Sassy Math is included in your config.rb file, you can use all of its might!*

## Constants

* `pi()` — _π_ or [Pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi).
* `e()` — _e_ or [Euler’s number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)).
* `golden-ratio()` - _φ_ or the [Golden Ratio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio).

## Functions

### Exponents
* `exponent($base, $power_numerator, $power_denominator)` - The $base raised to the given power where the power is a fraction in the form of `$power_numerator / $power_denominator`.
* `power($base, $power)` - The $base raised to the given $power where the power is an integer or floating point number.
* `nth-root($number, $root)` - The given $root of the input $number.
* `sqrt($number)` - The square root of the given $number.

### Logarithms
* `ln($number)` - The natural log of the $number.
* `log($number)` - The base 10 log of the $number

### Angular
Note: Compass comes with sine (`sin($radians)`), cosine (`cos($radians)`), and tangent (`tan($radians)`) functions already, so they aren't included as part of Sassy Math.

#### General

* `deg-to-rad($degrees)` - Returns the $degrees in radians.
* `rad-to-deg($radians)` - Returns the $radians in degrees (unitless).

#### Inverse Trigonometric

* `asin($radians)` - Arcsine of $radians. Constrained to the domain -1 ≤ $radians ≤ 1.
* `acos($radians)` - Arccosine of $radians. Constrained to the domain -1 ≤ $radians ≤ 1.
* `atan($radians)` - Arctangent of $radians.
* `atan2($y, $x)` - Arctangent given $x and $y.

#### Hyperbolic

* `sinh($radians)` - Hyperbolic sine of $radians.
* `cosh($radians)` - Hyperbolic cosine of $radians.
* `tanh($radians)` - Hyperbolic tangent of $radians.

#### Inverse Hyperbolic

* `asinh($radians)` - Hyperbolic arcsine of $radians.
* `acosh($radians)` - Hyperbolic arccosine of $radians. Constrained to the domain $radians < 1.
* `atanh($radians)` - Hyperbolic arctangent of $radians. $radians cannot equal ±1.

### Miscellaneous
* `factorial($number)` - The factorial of the $number.
* `random($max)` — Random number. The default max is 100 but you can specify whatever you want.
* `hypot($a, $b)` - Returns the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle given sides $a and $b

### Comparative
* `is-int($number)` - Determines whether or not the $number is an integer. Returns true or false.
* `is-float($number)` - Determines whether or not the $number is a floating point number. Returns true or false.
